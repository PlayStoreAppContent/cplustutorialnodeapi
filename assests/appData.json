For most of the cases its between the curly braces,in which variable is declared that a variable exists, not outside it. We will study the storage classes later, but as of now, we can broadly divide variables into two main types.<p>* Global Variables</p><p>* Local variables</p>",

They must be declared outside the main() function. If only declared, they can be assigned different values at different time in program lifetime. But even if they are declared and initialized at the same time outside the main() function, then also they can be assigned any value at any point in the program.<p>For example: Only declared, not initialized</p><p>#include <iostream></p><p>using namespace std;</p><p>int x;                // Global variable declared</p><p>int main()</p><p>{</p><p>    x=10;                 // Initialized once</p><p>    cout <<\"first value of x = \"<< x;</p><p>    x=20;                 // Initialized again</p><p>    cout <<\"Initialized again with value = \"<< x;</p><p>}</p>",

Outside that they are unavailable and leads to compile time error.<p>Example :</p><p>#include <iostream></p><p>using namespace std;</p><p>int main()</p><p>{</p><p>    int i=10;</p><p>    if(i<20)        // if condition scope starts</p><p>    {</p><p>        int n=100;   // Local variable declared and initialized</p><p>    }              // if condition scope ends</p><p>    cout << n;      // Compile time error, n not available here</p><p>}</p>",

Static - These variables holds their value between function calls.</p><p>Example :</p><p>#include <iostream.h></p><p>using namespace std;</p><p>int main()</p><p>{</p><p>    final int i=10;</p><p>    static int y=20;</p><p>}</p>"
